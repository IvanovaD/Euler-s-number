/**
Transforms for using a GPU via the aparapi library.<p>

This package contains Number-Theoretic Transform implementations that can use
the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) for executing the transforms. There is significant
overhead in invoking the GPU, e.g. in transferring the data between the main memory
and the GPU memory, so for small data sets there is usually no performance improvement,
and in many cases performance can be even significantly slower. However for very large
calculations, e.g. one billion digits, using the GPU can improve the performance noticeably,
depending on the hardware used.
